# Air Quality Analysis of Delhi in 2019 vs 2020. Effect of lockdown on pollution. 
## About Dataset
The dataset contains air quality data and AQI (Air Quality Index) at hourly and daily level of various stations across multiple cities in India. But I have used only Delhi's data for analysis. ## Analysis After cleaning the data and replacing the missing values, I tried to represent the different particulate matters in graphs to compare their levels in 2019 and 2020. <br> The Air Quality Index of March-May 2019 was 208 whereas in the same months during 2020 it was around 124. This gives us a clear picture of how Lockdown had reduced the pollution levels in the capital.
